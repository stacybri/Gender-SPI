## Data sources

Google Mobility Data was accessed from the following URL (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on 2020-07-23.

### Mobility Report CSV Documentation
This dataset is intended to help remediate the impact of COVID-19. It shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment purposes. It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel plans.

The data shows how visits to places, such as grocery stores and parks, are changing in each geographic region. Learn how you can use this dataset in your work by visiting Community Mobility Reports Help.

Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).

We’ll leave a region or category out of the dataset if we don’t have sufficient statistically significant levels of data. To learn how we calculate these trends and preserve privacy, read About this data below.

### Place categories
#### Grocery & pharmacy
Mobility trends for places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies.

#### Parks
Mobility trends for places like local parks, national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens.

#### Transit stations
Mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations.

#### Retail & recreation
Mobility trends for places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters.

#### Residential
Mobility trends for places of residence.

#### Workplaces
Mobility trends for places of work.

## About this data
These datasets show how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline. We calculate these changes using the same kind of aggregated and anonymized data used to show popular times for places in Google Maps.

Changes for each day are compared to a baseline value for that day of the week:

The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.
The datasets show trends over several months with the most recent data representing approximately 2-3 days ago—this is how long it takes to produce the datasets.
What data is included in the calculation depends on user settings, connectivity, and whether it meets our privacy threshold. When the data doesn't meet quality and privacy thresholds, you might see empty fields for certain places and dates.

We include categories that are useful to social distancing efforts as well as access to essential services.

We calculate these insights based on data from users who have opted-in to Location History for their Google Account, so the data represents a sample of our users. As with all samples, this may or may not represent the exact behavior of a wider population.

We continue to improve our reports as places close and reopen. We updated the way we calculate changes for Groceries & pharmacy, Retail & recreation, Transit stations, and Parks categories. For regions published before May 2020, the data may contain a consistent shift either up or down that starts between April 11–18, 2020.

## Preserving privacy
The Community Mobility Datasets were developed to be helpful while adhering to our stringent privacy protocols and protecting people’s privacy. No personally identifiable information, like an individual’s location, contacts or movement, is made available at any point.

Insights in these reports are created with aggregated, anonymized sets of data from users who have turned on the Location History setting, which is off by default. People who have Location History turned on can choose to turn it off at any time from their Google Account and can always delete Location History data directly from their Timeline.

The reports are powered by the same world-class anonymization technology that we use in our products every day to keep your activity data private and secure. This includes differential privacy, which adds artificial noise to our datasets, enabling us to generate insights without identifying any individual person. These privacy-preserving protections also ensure that the absolute number of visits isn’t shared.

Visit Google’s Privacy Policy to learn more about how we keep your data private, safe and secure.
